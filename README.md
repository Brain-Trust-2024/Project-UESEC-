# Project-UESEC- United Earth Space Exploration Command.
I build the web app portal and mongo db json database to store the ship Mission and Scheduling Operation.
It will serve the UESEC by enabling critical mission control over the personnel, ships and mission schedules.
I used the MVC (Multi, view, control) feature;

DATABASE 
------------------
I used the MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose for database connectivity.

Embedded Javascript (EJS)
I used ejs for advanced features and make web app modern apart from it, I used the error handing 
techniques like try catch block and performs the CRUD operation and aggregation to filter out the 
data.
